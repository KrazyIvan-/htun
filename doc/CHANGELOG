* 0.9.5
    - Maximum length for proxy auth username length increased.
    - Now allow '/' in proxy auth username for authentication again SMB.
    - New config directives to control client retries and timings.
    - Client now behaves better when the server responds with an error code.

* 0.9.4
    - Fixed faulty proto2 server behavior in event that client doesn't make a
      request in the allotted amount of time. Thanks to Adam Kramer.
    - Improved the logging.

* 0.9.3b
    - Added Content-Length header to 204 responses, as some proxies stalled
      waiting for it.

* 0.9.3a
    - Stupid oversight with the HTTP/1.1 problem that I won't admit to :)

* 0.9.3
    - Discovered that HTTP/1.1 responses problem supposedly fixed in last
      0.9.2 wasn't actually fixed. Fixed it again :-\
    - In server config, port is an alias for server_port, and secondary_port
      is an alias for secondary_server_port
    - Config parsing errors have been improved significantly.
    - Any IP address value in the config file may now be a domain name. HTun
      will resolve the name on startup.

* 0.9.2
    - Default of 20 sec for idle_disconnect in server options changed to 1800,
      as 20 was causing spurious disconnects of the client.
    - Config value min_poll_interval_usec changed to msec. Value is still in
      msec as it used to be before.
    - Added redirect_host and redirect_port options to server config.
    - Lots of aesthetic and code cleanup
    - Removed some values that were never used in the config. Recommend
      restarting from example config in doc/, which was also updated.
    - Fixed problem with recognizing certain HTTP/1.1 responses when expecting
      HTTP/1.0. Seems to happen with MS Proxy Server

* 0.9.1
    - Added ability to authenticate with proxy using username/password
    - Fixed a problem with parsing comments correctly in config file
    - HTun now comes with a better example config file

* 0.9.0
    - Initial Release
